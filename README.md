## Fair Deadlines

Countdown timers to keep track of a bunch of fair-ML / AI ethics / computational social sciences conference deadlines.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case the conference has a separate mandatory abstract deadline
